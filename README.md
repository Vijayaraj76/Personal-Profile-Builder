## Features

- **Age Calculation**: Automatically calculates your age based on the date of birth provided.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. **Age Calculation**
   - The `calculate_age()` function calculates the user's age by comparing their birth year, month, and day with the current date.

### 2. **Input Validation**
   - The `get_valid_date()` function ensures that the user enters a valid birth date, checking for correct year, month, and day ranges.

### 3. **Profile Summary**
   - After gathering the user's input, the script generates a personalized profile summary and displays it, including motivational comments based on the user's age and education level.

### 4. **Saving the Profile**
   - The user is asked if they would like to save the generated profile. If they choose "yes", the profile is saved in a `.txt` file with a filename based on their name.
